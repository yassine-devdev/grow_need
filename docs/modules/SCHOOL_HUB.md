# Module: School Hub

**File Path**: `/components/modules/SchoolHubModule.tsx`

The School Hub is the most comprehensive and feature-rich module in the application. It's a central management system tailored for educational institutions, with role-based views for different user types. It provides a unique set of dashboards and tools for every persona involved in the educational ecosystem.

## Navigation
The School Hub uses a two-level navigation system. 
1. The main tabs at the top (L1) represent different user roles or administrative domains. 
2. The vertical icon sidebar on the left (L2) provides access to the specific tools and dashboards available within that role.
