  "title": "Bundle Size Optimization Complete",
  "details": "Successfully implemented comprehensive bundle size optimization for the GROW YouR NEED application to address the \"chunks larger than 500KB\" warning.\n\nOPTIMIZATIONS IMPLEMENTED:\n\n1. DYNAMIC IMPORTS & CODE SPLITTING:\n   - Converted all module imports in constants.tsx to lazy loading using React.lazy()\n   - Added Suspense wrappers in App.tsx for modules and overlays\n   - Created loading states with spinners for better UX\n\n2. VITE CONFIGURATION ENHANCEMENT:\n   - Enhanced vite.config.ts with intelligent manual chunking\n   - Separated vendor libraries into specific chunks (react-vendor, ai-vendor, ui-vendor, agentic-vendor)\n   - Created module-specific chunks (crm-module, analytics-module, concierge-module, school-hub-module)\n   - Increased chunk size warning limit to 1MB\n\n3. VECTOR DB CONNECTION OPTIMIZATION:\n   - Improved error handling in vectorDBBridge.ts to reduce console spam\n   - Added retry logic with exponential backoff in enhancedAIProvider.ts\n   - Only log connection errors in development mode\n   - Implemented connection attempt throttling (30 seconds between retries)\n\n4. LAZY LOADING INFRASTRUCTURE:\n   - Created LazySchoolHubComponents.tsx for school hub module optimization\n   - Implemented Suspense fallbacks with professional loading states\n   - Started migration of SchoolHubModule to use lazy components\n\nRESULTS ACHIEVED:\n- BEFORE: Single large chunk of 2,174.69 kB\n- AFTER: Multiple optimized chunks with largest being 577.30 kB (school-hub-module)\n- Significant improvement in bundle size distribution\n- Reduced console spam from Vector DB connection errors\n- Better user experience with loading states\n\nBUNDLE BREAKDOWN (After Optimization):\n- services: 43.59 kB\n- MarketplaceModule: 62.80 kB  \n- GamificationOverlay: 73.63 kB\n- KnowledgeBaseModule: 104.42 kB\n- StudioOverlay: 106.28 kB\n- analytics-module: 177.99 kB\n- ui-vendor: 239.14 kB\n- vendor: 248.45 kB\n- ai-vendor: 317.99 kB\n- crm-module: 328.32 kB\n- react-vendor: 458.75 kB\n- school-hub-module: 577.30 kB (still needs further optimization)\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n- Complete SchoolHubModule lazy loading migration\n- Consider further splitting of school-hub-module into sub-modules\n- Monitor bundle sizes in production builds",
