  "title": "Agentic Tools MCP Integration Progress",
  "details": "Successfully integrated the @pimzino/agentic-tools-mcp package into the GROW YouR NEED project. This provides advanced AI capabilities including:\n\nFEATURES INTEGRATED:\n- Advanced Task Management: Unlimited hierarchy, dependencies, priorities (1-10), complexity estimation (1-10), status workflow (pending → in-progress → blocked → done)\n- Agent Memories: Intelligent search, categorization, metadata support, JSON file storage\n- AI Agent Tools: PRD parsing, task recommendations, complexity analysis, progress inference, research integration\n- Project-Specific Storage: Git-trackable data in .agentic-tools-mcp/ directory\n\nTECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Package installed: @pimzino/agentic-tools-mcp v1.8.1\n- Configuration file: mcp-config.json\n- TypeScript integration: src/services/agenticToolsIntegration.ts\n- Working directory: C:\\Users\\Acer\\Downloads\\Video\\grow_need\n\nCAPABILITIES GAINED:\n1. Unlimited task nesting depth with parentId relationships\n2. Intelligent task recommendations based on dependencies and priorities\n3. Automatic complexity analysis and task breakdown suggestions\n4. Progress inference from codebase analysis\n5. Hybrid web research with memory caching\n6. Persistent agent knowledge with intelligent search\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n- Implement enhanced task management system\n- Set up agent memory system for context retention\n- Integrate AI agent tools for workflow automation\n- Create research integration for knowledge building\n- Test and validate all features\n\nThis integration significantly enhances AI assistant capabilities with professional-grade task management and persistent memory systems.",
