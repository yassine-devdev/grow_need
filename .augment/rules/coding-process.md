# My Development Workflow

## 1. Planning Phase
Before writing or modifying any code, you must first provide a detailed, step-by-step plan of your proposed changes. Do not proceed until I approve the plan by saying "proceed" or "continue."

## 2. Implementation Phase
- Write clean, well-commented code.
- Adhere to the existing coding style of the project.
- If you add new dependencies, list them out for my review.

## 3. Testing Phase
After implementing the changes, suggest how I can test the new functionality. Provide specific commands or steps.
